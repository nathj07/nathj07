# Welcome

I'm Nathan and this is my personal GitHub account. Here you will find projects in various states of completion, and of varying use.

Most of the time I write in [Go](https://go.dev/) and so the projects here are mostly in Go. 

You will also find the slides for talks I have given at my local [Go meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Golang-North-East/)
